Line-following Robot:

Code for building a line-following robot using Arduino and IR sensors.
The robot can detect and follow a line on the ground, adjusting its direction to stay on course.
The code is well-commented and includes detailed explanations of how the IR sensors detect the line and how the motor driver controls the robot's movement.
Calibration instructions are provided to help you fine-tune the robot's performance based on your specific setup.



Obstacle Avoiding Robot:

Code for creating an obstacle-avoiding robot using ultrasonic sensors and Arduino.
The robot can detect obstacles in its path and adjust its direction to avoid collisions.
Detailed comments and explanations are included to help you understand how the ultrasonic sensors measure distances and how the robot's logic decides on movement actions.
Tips for improving the robot's obstacle detection and avoidance capabilities.




RC Robot Using PS3 Controller with ESP32:

Code for controlling a robot using a PS3 controller connected to an ESP32.
The ESP32 processes inputs from the PS3 controller to remotely control the robot's movements.
Clear instructions on how to pair the PS3 controller with the ESP32 and configure the ESP32 to receive commands.
Well-commented code to help you understand how the controller inputs are mapped to motor actions and how to modify the code for your specific needs.




HC-05 Bluetooth Module Controlled Robot:

Code for controlling a robot using an HC-05 Bluetooth module connected to an Arduino.
The HC-05 module receives commands from a mobile app, allowing you to control the robot remotely.
Detailed instructions on how to set up the HC-05 module, pair it with the mobile app, and configure the Arduino to interpret the received commands.
Simplified and well-commented code to help you understand the communication between the mobile app and the Arduino, and how to map commands to motor actions.




MPU-6050 Sensor Integration with Arduino:

This repository includes a project that demonstrates how to interface an MPU-6050 sensor with an Arduino. The MPU-6050 is a 6-axis motion tracking device that combines a 3-axis gyroscope and a 3-axis accelerometer. This project shows how to read data from the sensor and map it to a usable format.
